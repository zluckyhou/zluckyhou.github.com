It was the best of time, it was the worst of time, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us；we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.



时之圣者也，时之凶者也。此亦蒙昧世，此亦智慧世。此亦光明时节，此亦黯淡时节。此亦笃信之年，此亦大惑之年。此亦多丽之阳春，此亦绝念之穷冬。人或万事俱备，人或一事无成。我辈其青云直上，我辈其黄泉永坠。当时有识之士咸谓人间善恶或臻至极。亦必事有所本，势无可绾，但居之习之可也。
