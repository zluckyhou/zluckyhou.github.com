标题中这句话是Adobe CEO在与挪威主权财富基金CEO Nicolai Tangen的对话播客中提到的，他认为年轻人做事应该源于热情，而不是出于对职业生涯的考虑，做自己不喜欢的事。

这篇播客还谈到了很多话题，包括Adobe的业务，对AI、deepfakes的看法，美国大公司中印度CEO的领导力，航海，对年轻人的建议，等等。很多对话都富有启发性，这里再额外摘录两段对话：

一是关于AI是否会替代人的看法。
这也是AI时代很多人关心的话题，最近百度在成都推出的无人驾驶汽车就是一个很好的例子。AI的发展让很多人感到担忧，但是Shantanu 认为实际上应该是” people who use AI will replace people who don't use AI.”，因为实际中他们考虑的是，如何利用AI来提升效率，在同样成本的情况下实现更多的产出。就像任何一次技术革命一样，一些事的确会受到冲击，但是总体上新的技术提供了更多的机会，提供了更多的创造力。

二是关于帆船的讨论。
Shantanu 和Nicolai都参与过帆船运动（sailing），Shantanu 认为帆船是一种与自然融为一体的体验，它让人意识到自己在世界中只是很小的一部分，在比赛中，人们必须不断地努力提高自己。Nicolai觉得帆船运动的独特之处在于，帆船比赛中，领先者可能因为风向改变而落后，每一场比赛都需要承担同样的风险，与乒乓球等没有外部因素影响的运动不同，帆船运动受到最多外部因素的影响，帆船运动有很多值得学习的地方。


以下是上面三段对话的采访原文：

对年轻人的建议

> **N: Lastly, we have tens of thousands of young people listening to these podcasts. What is your advice to them?**
> 
> 
> S: You know, first I would say the world's your oyster, right? I mean, it is just an incredible time to pursue your passions. Access to capital exists, and access to information exists right now with how much of that is being democratized. So, pursue your passions.
> 
> I was fortunate in that I didn't follow the conventional path. When I did my MBA, everybody said, "Hey, you now have to go into product management or business management." And I'm like, "I would like building products. I'm going to build it." I think people really do their best work when you come to work in the morning and you don't think it's work. You come because you have a passion. You can't wait to get out of bed.
> 
> Find something that gives you that feeling, which is like, "I like being here. I like engaging with people." If you're doing it because you think it's the right thing, or it's a step along the way and you hate it but believe it's good for your career, it's not going to work. So, follow your passion.
> 

对AI的看法

> What I always say is people who use AI will replace people who don't use AI. Everybody talks about how this is going to replace humans. Well, the place where AI is probably the most advanced is in software writing.
> 
> When you think about what's happened with the ability to say, "I want to create a program," that's what's the most expensive. I don't know if at your institution, you're reducing the number of software engineers and developers. We're all saying, how do we make them more productive? How do we allow them to do more at the same cost? So there will be an efficiency increase.
> 
> Like every generation of technology, some things will get disrupted, but overall it creates more opportunity. And I certainly believe that for creativity.
> 

关于帆船运动

> **What have you taken from sailing? You represented IND giant sailing.** 
> 
> You know, sailing in those days was just an incredible passion. I mean, you were one with nature. And maybe one of the things you recognize is, to some degree, when you're sailing, you are also passionate about sailing. You're with this force of nature and you recognize that you're a small cog in the world, but you're then trying to channel this wind and the waves.
> 
> Sailing in Bombay, where you're sailing in the waves, was just this incredible rush. Competitively, you're constantly trying to improve. Sadly, I've given up sailing, Nikolai. When I came to this country, I focused on education and family, and now golf is the thing. 
> 
> **But I'll tell you what I liked about sailing. You can be in the lead, and then the wind changes, and you are last.In the next race, you have to take the same amount of risk. Think about table tennis; there are no external factors. Sailing has the maximum amount of external factors. There is so much to learn from it.**
> 
> I agree. How often do you get to sail?
> 
> **Way too little because I'm in the office too much.(hahahha)**
