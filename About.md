It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age offoolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so. far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
这是最好的时代，也是最坏的时代；这是智慧的时代，也是愚蠢的时代；这是信任的年代，也是怀疑的年代；这是光明的季节，也是黑暗的季节；这是希望的春天，也是失望的冬天；我们的前途无量，同时又感到希望渺茫；我们一齐奔向天堂，我们全都走向另一个方向……
